# float-to-str-Function
Python doesn't convert float into str as basic numeric combinations in some situations, so this function is to convert them to their respective basic numeric combinations.

For instance, float value '0.000000000445' will be converted to str as '4.45e-10'.
This basic piece of code is just to unpack this into basic numeric version. In this case, to '0.000000000445'.
